# jQuery-Day-Planner

here is my completed jquery day planner. Max gave me a pretty good base to work with working through the text area id, and giving each save button a value that is equivilent with military time. 

I initially had some trouble with getting my local storage to work, since it was not in the for loop, but after some research and  testing, I moved the getItem into my loop, so that it will recognize each input, and fiexed my problem. I sort of reverse engineered what i had based off of what I had seen in manipulating my text area ID and my save buttons, and used that throughout this project as I was told that this problem can be solved in many less lines of code that originally inteded after talking with my TA.
